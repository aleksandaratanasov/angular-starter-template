Angular starter template
========================

You can use gulp to serve the content and have live reload in the browser enabled.

What you need to setup:

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Execute `npm install -g gulp` (with root/admin rights) somewhere to install gulp globally
* Execute `npm install` in the checked out folder
* Use `gulp` to serve the content

You can alternatively use any web server you like to serve the content of the `src` folder.
